### MauiKit / Kirigami

#### Build Beautiful, Convergent Apps that Run on Phones, TVs and Everything in Between.

The line between desktop and mobile is blurring and users expect the same quality experience on every device. Applications using KDE adapt brilliantly to mobile, desktop, TVs, infortainment systems and everything in between.

KDE's components are goodlooking and consistent. Users of MauiKit / Kirigami apps will appreciate the smart choices made in the API and uncluttered design.

### KDevelop

#### A cross-platform IDE for C, C++, Python, QML/JavaScript and PHP

Open Source, powerful and fast, KDevelop offers a seamless development environment to programmers that work on projects of any size. KDevelop helps you get the job done while staying out of your way.
